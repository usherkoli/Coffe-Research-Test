## Task
          # Hhypotheses: 
H1 predicts that women are willing to pay more than men for coffee. 
H2 predicts that the older a person is, the more they are willing to pay for a cup of coffee.
## Method
         # Participants
The participants were 25 adults (10 men, 15 women) ages 18 – 28 (M = 22.64, SD = 3.29). These adults completed the survey voluntarily and were not compensated for their time.
# Materials and Procedure
	This study used an online survey to gather data from participants. The survey consisted of three questions. The first question asked about gender. Two response options were provided (1 = male, 2 = female). The second question was a free-response question asking about age. Finally, participants were asked to state the wiliness to pay more for a coffee (in dollars).
## Results
	Hypothesis 1 predicted that Women are willing to pay more than men for coffee. The result of the test supported this hypothesis. Results of an independent t-test showed the frequency of how much women are they willing to pay for a cup of coffee (in dollars) (M = 2.88, SD = 1.15) was significantly greater than men’s frequency of men wiliness to pay more for a coffee (M =2.17, SD = 0.86), t = -1.78, statistically significant at p = 0.04, at 0.05 significance level and 1 tailed analysis result.  
	Hypothesis 2 predicted that the older a person is, the more they are willing to pay for a cup of coffee and there was a significant correlation between age and frequency of how much are they willing to pay for a cup of coffee (in dollars), such that younger adults would be less willing to pay more for a cup of coffee than older adults. This hypothesis was supported. There was a significant relationship between age and frequency of how much are they willing to pay for a cup of coffee (in dollars), r = 0.78, p = 0.00. At 0.05 significance level and 2 tailed analysis result.
